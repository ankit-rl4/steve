We aim to develop a comprehensive AI-driven marketing solution by fine-tuning GPT-4 from Microsoft Azure. This model will be trained on banking conversational data, financial reports, and marketing data to address a wide range of queries and generate effective marketing content. Once a centralized banking specific LLM model is created we will use multiple RAG along with it to generate SMS, Phone, email and website based marketing content.
Solution Overview:
1.	Model Fine-Tuning:
o	Data Sources: Fine-tune GPT-4 using diverse data sources such as banking conversational data, financial reports, and marketing data. This ensures the model comprehends industry-specific terminology and nuances.
o	Model Training: Implement continuous learning and training processes to keep the model updated with the latest data and trends.

2.	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
o	Template Generation: Leverage RAG to create a variety of marketing templates tailored to different promotional needs and customer segments.
o	Template Customization: Allow the marketing team to review, adjust, and create their own templates using prompts, ensuring flexibility and creativity.

3.	Content Personalization:
o	Customer-Specific Information: Populate templates with personalized customer data, ensuring each message is relevant and engaging.
o	Variation in Language and Schemes: Incorporate variations in language and promotional schemes to cater to diverse customer preferences and demographics.

4.	Automated Delivery:
o	Multichannel Marketing: Automatically deliver personalized marketing content through multiple channels, including email, SMS, phone, and social media. Ensure timely and coordinated campaigns across all platforms.
o	Scalability: Design the system to handle increasing volumes of data and requests, ensuring consistent performance.

Using SMS and phone marketing we can also target rural customer segment, making personalised marketing content for them as well as most of the customers that the bank has is in rural regions,  here we would also integrate government schemes to make our customers aware of it and benefit from it.
